# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the starter kit as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Improving documentation

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Set up your development environment (see below)
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes
5. Submit a pull request

## Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/starter-kit.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Creating Issues

1. **For New Features:**
   - Create an issue with the `suggestion` label
   - Provide detailed description and use cases
   - Mention if you'd like to implement it yourself
   - Wait for approval before starting development

2. **For Bug Fixes:**
   - Check existing issues with `bug` label
   - Look for `good first issue` label for beginner-friendly tasks
   - Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### Making Changes
