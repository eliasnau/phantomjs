# Installation

You will need to clone the repository and install all the required dependencies.

## Cloning the repository

To clone the repository, create a new folder and within that folder run the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Git">

git clone https://github.com/eliasnau/starter-kit.git
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="GitHub CLI">

```

</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can also clone it using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application.

## Install the dependencies

This starter kit currently uses PNPM as the package manager. If you prefer to use a different one, delete the `pnpm-lock.yaml` before.

To install the dependencies, do as follows:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

If your preferred package manager is not mentioned, find the equivalent command for the one you use.
