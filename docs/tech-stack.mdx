# Tech Stack

After creating numerous projects and exploring various tools, I've curated this stack to combine the best modern web technologies. Built on top of the excellent T3 Stack by Theo, this starter kit extends it with additional tools I've found invaluable in production applications.

## Core Foundation

### üèó T3 Stack Base
Built on the amazing [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg), which provides:
- **Next.js** - The React framework for production
- **TypeScript** - Type safety from the ground up
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

I chose T3 as the foundation because it provides a clean, modular starting point without the bloat of create-next-app, while maintaining complete flexibility in styling and architecture.

## Database & ORM

### üåä Drizzle ORM
Instead of Prisma, I opted for Drizzle because:
- Lighter weight and faster execution
- Type-safe SQL queries
- No additional runtime dependency
- Better development experience with simple migrations
- Superior performance in production

## Authentication

### üîê Better-Auth
A modern, type-safe authentication solution that provides:
- Multiple authentication strategies (OAuth, Email/Password)
- Email verification
- Session management
- Rate limiting
- Custom hooks and utilities

## Email System

### üìß React Email + Nodemailer
- **React Email** - Write emails using React components
- **Nodemailer** - Reliable email delivery
- Type-safe email templates
- Preview mode for development

## Styling & UI

### üé® Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind
- Beautiful, accessible components from shadcn/ui
- Consistent design language
- Easy customization
- Dark mode support

## Developer Experience

### üõ† Development Tools
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **TypeScript** - End-to-end type safety
- **pnpm** - Fast, disk-efficient package manager

## Why This Stack?

After years of building web applications, I've encountered common patterns and pain points. This stack addresses them by:

1. **Type Safety First**
   - No more runtime surprises
   - Better developer experience
   - Catch errors early

2. **Modern Development**
   - Latest React features
   - Optimal performance
   - Great DX out of the box

3. **Production Ready**
   - Battle-tested technologies
   - Scalable architecture
   - Security best practices

4. **Developer Friendly**
   - Clear project structure
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Easy to extend

## Personal Note

This starter kit represents my ideal setup for modern web applications. It's opinionated where it matters (type safety, code quality) but flexible where you need it (styling, architecture). It's the result of countless projects and learning experiences, designed to help you build better applications faster.

:::tip Why I Built This
After using various starter templates and frameworks, I found that while many were good, they either included too much or too little. This starter kit aims to strike the perfect balance - giving you a robust foundation while staying lightweight and flexible.
