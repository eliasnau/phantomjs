# Database with Drizzle ORM

## Introduction

This starter kit uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team), a lightweight, type-safe SQL ORM that provides excellent developer experience without compromising on performance.

### Project Structure

Our database code is organized in `src/server/db/`:
- `schema.ts` - Table definitions and relationships
- `index.ts` - Database connection and configuration
- `queries.ts` - Centralized query functions

### Example Query

Here's a simple query to demonstrate Drizzle's type-safe approach:

```typescript
import { db } from ".";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { users } from "./schema";

export const getUserById = async (id: string) => {
    const user = await db.query.users.findFirst({
        where: eq(users.id, id),
        columns: {
            id: true,
            email: true,
            name: true,
            createdAt: true,
        },
    });
    return user;
};
```

Key features demonstrated:
- Type-safe queries with TypeScript
- Intuitive query building
- Automatic type inference
- Column selection for performance

:::tip Why Drizzle?
We chose Drizzle over other ORMs because:
- Zero runtime overhead
- Type-safe SQL queries
- Simple migration system
- Great developer experience
- Superior performance
