# Two-Factor Authentication

:::warning Development Status
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) support is currently in development and will be available in a future release.
:::

## Planned Features

The upcoming 2FA implementation will include:
- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) support
- QR code generation for easy setup
- Backup codes generation
- Multiple authenticator app support
- Recovery options

## Current Status

While 2FA is being developed, you can enhance your application's security by:
- Enabling email verification
- Implementing strong password requirements
- Setting appropriate rate limits
- Using secure session management

## Future Implementation

The 2FA system will be integrated into the existing authentication flow in `src/lib/auth.ts`:

```typescript
export const auth = betterAuth({
    twoFactor: {
        enabled: true,
        // Additional 2FA configuration options will be available here
    }
});
```
