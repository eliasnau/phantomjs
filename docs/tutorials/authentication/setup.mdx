# Authentication Setup

This starter kit uses [Better-Auth](https://better-auth.dev) for authentication. For advanced configurations and additional features, refer to the [Better-Auth documentation](https://better-auth.dev/docs).

## Environment Variables

The following variables need to be configured in your `.env.local` file for authentication:

### General Settings
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Your application's public URL
  - Development: `localhost:3000`
  - Production: `https://your-domain.com`
  - Used for callbacks and public-facing URLs

### Authentication Settings
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: Secret key for encrypting sessions and tokens
  - Generate using:
    1. [Online Generator](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32)
    2. Terminal: `openssl rand -base64 32`
  - ⚠️ Must be changed in production
  - Keep this value private and never commit it

- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: Base URL for authentication callbacks
  - Development: `http://localhost:3000`
  - Production: `https://your-domain.com`
  - Must include protocol (http/https)

### OAuth Settings (Optional)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Your GitHub OAuth app client ID
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your GitHub OAuth app secret
  - Both obtained from [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
  - Required only if using GitHub authentication

### Email Settings (Optional)
- `SMTP_HOST`: Your SMTP server hostname
- `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP port (usually 587 or 465)
- `SMTP_SECURE`: Use TLS (true for 465, false for other ports)
- `SMTP_USER`: SMTP account username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP account password
- `SMTP_FROM`: Sender email address
  - Required only for email/password authentication
  - Used for verification and password reset emails

:::danger Important
Never commit sensitive credentials to version control. Use `.env.local` for your secrets.
